                <h3>Minnie Mouse</h3>
                <p> She is Mickey Mouse's girlfriend. Her birthday is on 18th November 1928. Minnie Mouse’s parents are both farmers. Marcus Mouse is her father’s name
                    and Minnie’s mother’s name is Margie Mouse. Minnie Mouse also has a sister called Mandie Mouse. It seems that Minnie’s closest friends are Daisy Duck,
                    Donald Duck’s girlfriend, and also sometimes Clarabelle Cow. She often goes shopping with Daisy and she spends a lot of time with her.

        <div  id="donald" class="par2">
                <h3>Donald Duck</h3>
                <p> Donald's two dominant personality traits are his fiery-temper and his upbeat attitude to life. Many Donald shorts start with Donald in a happy mood, without a care
                    in the world until something comes along and spoils his day. His rage is a great cause of suffering in his life. On multiple occasions, it has caused him to get in over
                    his head and lose competitions. There are times when he fights to keep his temper in check, and he sometimes succeeds in doing so temporarily, but he always returns to
                    his normal angry self in the end.

        <div id="daisy" class="par1">
            <h3>Daisy Duck</h3>
            <p> Daisy is a white duck with an orange bill and legs. She usually has indigo eyeshadow, long distinct eyelashes and ruffled feathers around her lowest
                region to suggest a skirt. Daisy is shown to be a loving girlfriend; always there for Donald,
                but always having the tendency to nag in an attempt to change his ways for the better.She enjoys fashion and shopping above all else and,
                although well-bred and sophisticated when she wants to be, can be a bit eccentric and overbearing at times, specifically when paired with the more demure Minnie, the two serving as foils.

        <div id="goofy" class="par2">
                <h3>Goofy</h3>
                <p>
                    Clumsy, unintelligent, and humble are some of the words that describe Goofy, who speaks with a southern drawl. Living a rather simple lifestyle, Goofy tends to miss the obvious,
                    act somewhat childish and absent-minded, and gets confused very easily. As a result of these factors, Goofy is rather accident-prone and is an easy target for trouble. Nevertheless,
                    his blissfulness usually keeps him from any legitimate harm, as he tends to walk away from life-threatening danger with a smile and his signature guffaw. However, Goofy is aware of
                    his fairly limited intelligence, and though usually self-loving, he does not always enjoy being goofy.

            <h3>Pluto</h3>
                <p>
                    Pluto, also called <em>Pluto the Pup</em>, is a cartoon dog created in 1930 at Walt Disney Productions. He is a
                    yellow-orange color, medium-sized, short-haired dog with black ears. Unlike most Disney characters, Pluto is not
                    anthropomorphic beyond some characteristics such as facial expression. He is Mickey Mouse's pet. Pluto is generally
                    a cheerful and adventurous dog, although he can be given to sheer panic when confronted with something unknown.
